# Onsemi-ISP-Tuning

Brief report: http://berk.ozkan.ug.bilkent.edu.tr/pdfs/Karel-Onsemi-ISP-Tuning.pdf

This is my first project from my internship at Karel (https://www.karel.com.tr/). I was tasked with creating an application that would allow the engineers here to tinker with the Onsemi AS0149AT image sensor. 

This task required me to:
- Develop a serial communication protocol with tll uart chip.
- Learn Qt.
- Use SQLite for a small scale database.
- Learn about image sensors.
- Manage register values.
